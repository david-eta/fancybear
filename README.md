Your audience for the Readme.md are other developers who are joining your team.
Specifically, the file should contain detailed instructions that any developer
can follow to install, compile, run, and test your project. These are not only
useful to new developers, but also to you when you have to re-install everything
because your old laptop crashed. Also, the teachers of this class will be
following your instructions.

## External Requirements

In order to build this project you first have to install:

- You need to install Python (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- You need to install Django (https://www.djangoproject.com/)

If possible, list the actual commands you used to install these, so the reader
can just cut-n-paste the commands and get everything setup.

## Setup

Using whatever IDE you prefer, clone the repo to your local machine to work with it.

## Running

While in the fancy-bear directory
python3 manage.py runserver

# Deployment

The application is deployed on Microsoft Azure

# Testing

Before running the tests, make sure you are using a virtual environment to avoid conflicting with your global Python setup. Create the virtual environment outside your project folder to separate dependencies. 
Once the virtual environment is activated, change the directory to the project folder (fancybear).
Install all required dependencies by running the following command: pip install -r requirements.txt
Execute the unit tests by running the following command from the main directory of your project: python manage.py test tests

## Testing Technology

Built in testing library from Python.

Explain how to run the automated tests.
