# FancyBear Stock App

This first paragraph should be a short description of the app. You can add links
to your wiki pages that have more detailed descriptions.


StockApp is a webapp, running on any browser, hosted on Microsoft Azure, which will show the user current stocks available to trade. 

Your audience for the Readme.md are other developers who are joining your team.
Specifically, the file should contain detailed instructions that any developer
can follow to install, compile, run, and test your project. These are not only
useful to new developers, but also to you when you have to re-install everything
because your old laptop crashed. Also, the teachers of this class will be
following your instructions.

## External Requirements

In order to build this project you first have to install:

- You need to install Python (https://www.python.org/downloads/)

If possible, list the actual commands you used to install these, so the reader
can just cut-n-paste the commands and get everything setup.
