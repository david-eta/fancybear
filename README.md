# FancyBear Stock App
This is a clone of a repository from my USC Capstone project I worked on with group members. The original repository is private and cannot be accessed. Through this readme, I may speak in the terms "we" or "our" to represent myself and my group members.

Without further ado, the FancyBear Stock App. FancyBear is a web-based platform that simulates the experience of stock trading. Users dive into the world of trading by depositing virtual cash, which they can use to buy and sell stocks in real-time, mimicking the dynamics of the actual stock market. It is aimed to be user-friendly and allows anyone to track their stocks with confidence.

### Backend Technologies
This app was created using [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), a [Python](https://www.python.org/) web framework. Django is a very elaborate framework that made it easy to implement many of our funcionality easily. We saved the data on a SQLite database, which is the built-in feature that comes with Django apps. When we hosted the app through [](https://www.heroku.com)Heroku, we used a Postgresql resource.

### Frontend Technologies
The frontend was mainly HTML and CSS with some Django commands. To make the interactions smoother and more seamless, we used some JavaScript (JS). This was either in the HTML or in local, static, JS files.
With StockApp, users can effortlessly manage their investments by adding purchased stocks to our platform and tracking them with ease. The intuitive interface allows users to search for their desired stocks, seamlessly adding or removing them from their portfolio. 

The portfolio page provides a comprehensive overview of all purchased stocks, empowering users with valuable insights into their investment portfolio. Additionally, users can conveniently organize their favorite stocks in the Favorites tab and review past transactions in the Trade History tab. 


## Installation

In order to build this project you first have to install:

- You need to install Python through this [link](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Once you do so and add Python to PATH, install django through ```pip install django```

If possible, list the actual commands you used to install these, so the reader
can just cut-n-paste the commands and get everything setup.

## Setup

Using whatever IDE you prefer, clone the repo to your local machine to work with it.

## Running

While in the fancy-bear directory
python3 manage.py runserver

# Deployment

The application is deployed on Microsoft Azure

# Testing

Before running the tests, make sure you are using a virtual environment to avoid conflicting with your global Python setup. Create the virtual environment outside your project folder to separate dependencies. 
Once the virtual environment is activated, change the directory to the project folder (fancybear).
Install all required dependencies by running the following command: pip install -r requirements.txt
Execute the unit tests by running the following command from the main directory of your project: python manage.py test tests

## Testing Technology

Built in testing library from Python.
